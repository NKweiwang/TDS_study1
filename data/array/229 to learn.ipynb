    "The essential concepts is you keep a counter for the majority number X. If you find a number Y that is not X, the current counter should deduce 1. The reason is that if there is 5 X and 4 Y, there would be one (5-4) more X than Y. This could be explained as \"4 X being paired out by 4 Y\".\n",
    "\n",
    "And since the requirement is finding the majority for more than ceiling of [n/3], the answer would be less than or equal to two numbers.\n",
    "So we can modify the algorithm to maintain two counters for two majorities.\n",
